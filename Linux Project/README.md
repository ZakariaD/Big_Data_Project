The project is a program written in the bash scripting language. This program should allow the user

to perform requests on a large CSV (Comma Separated Values) dataset file. This dataset reflects

reported incidents of crime that occurred in the City of Chicago from 2001 to present. Data is

extracted from the Chicago Police Department's CLEAR (Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and

Reporting) system.

The dataset file can be downloaded at the following address: http://bit.ly/1Kx6quF
